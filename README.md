# Loadout Optimizer for Monster Hunter: World

A [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) application that attempts to efficiently find the most optimal
loadout(s) according to a user-provided scoring function. Uses dynamic programming to reduce search time in exchange for
using more memory.

## How To Run
From the root of the Git checkout:
1. Build the Spring Boot jar by running `mvn package`.
2. Start the Spring Boot application by running `java -jar target/mhw-loadout-optimizer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

By default, the application will come up at `localhost:8080`

## Requesting Loadouts
The application supports Swagger 2.0 documentation, both as JSON (at `/v2/api-docs`) and as a UI (at
`/swagger-ui.html`). These are autogenerated and somewhat rough at the moment, but should ge the general ideas across.

A GET request to `/loadouts` will return a sample response for a request to find the best loadouts meeting the following
criteria:
* Level 5 Earplugs
* Level 3 Windproof
* Level 3 Tremor Resistance
* As many decoration slots as possible
    * Level 2 and 3 decoration slots are considered 0.5 times as valuable as a point in the desired skill
    * Level 1 decoration slots are considered 0.25 times as valuable as a point in the desired skill
* As few armor pieces as possible

To manually request loadouts using the same criteria as the GET request POST the following data to `/loadouts`:
```$json
{
  "skillWeights": {
    "Earplugs": {
      "maximum": 5,
      "weight": 1.0
    },
    "Windproof": {
      "maximum": 3,
      "weight": 1.0
    },
    "Tremor Resistance": {
      "maximum": 3,
      "weight": 1.0
    }
  },
  "level1SlotWeight": 0.25,
  "level2SlotWeight": 0.5,
  "level3SlotWeight": 0.5,
  "loadoutSizeWeight": -0.25
}
```

## To Do
* **Add a GUI**.
* **Complete the data.** The armor piece data is stored in a tab-separated value file on the classpath. It is not
complete; I've simply been transcribing data from [Kiranico](https://mhworld.kiranico.com/) based on the skills I was
interested in using at a given moment. The names used for armor pieces do not match the in-game names.
* **Add the ability to recommend decorations for loadouts.**
* **Add the ability to account for set bonuses.**  The groundwork has been laid, but set bonuses cannot yet be requested
from the `/loadout` endpoint.
